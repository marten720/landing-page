        <p>Bob Jefferson was just 15 years old when he decided he wanted to 
           open up a plant store. Back then he had no clue how to run a 
           business, but his passion and desire to make other people smile 
           helped him thrive. Now, over 30 years later and having sold over 6 
           million plants, Bob is one of the most successful plant store owners
           in the country.</p>
